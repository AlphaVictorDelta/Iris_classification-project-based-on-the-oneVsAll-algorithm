Classification project to classify three sets of Iris flowers namely Iris_setosa(1), Iris_versicolor(2), and Iris_verginica(3)

You can head to the links to get a idea about the flowers!

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica

the dataset ('iris.dat') has 150 training examples (i.e 50 for each flower) with ‘4’ features for each flower. The features of the flowers are as follows :
	Sepal length in cm
	Sepal width in cm
	Petal length in cm
	Petal width in cm


You must have the Octave or Matlab to implement this project. I recommend using Octave because it’s free and compatible with this project. You can download Octave here :

iris_main.m file is like the skeleton for this project because it contains all the function calling statements.
